# The research report assignment: Outline introduction {#sec-report-intro}

In the Department of Psychology at Lancaster University, in the MSc programme module *PSYC401*, we ask students to analyse a previously collected dataset and write a report about their findings.
This is the **research report** assignment.

We are providing materials to support your work.
Because you are here, in the book, I start by identifying the chapters, but see @sec-report-intro-lecture, below, for information on lectures.

Different people prefer to take different approaches to course materials.
We ahev designed the materials to allow you to take the approach you prefer.

- You can begin by viewing the lecture recording then read some or all of the chapters. The lecture mostly focuses on an explanation of the context and motivations for the exercise --- explaining *why* you will benefit --- to help you understand *what* you should do.
- Or you can jump right in, and get reading here for an in-depth explanation on what we want you to do, why and how we want you to do it.
- *In class*, we will be ready to talk about your questions and your ideas with you. Be sure to come to class ready to call on our help.

## Chapters with information on why, what and how {#sec-report-intro-chapters} 

We have written a series of chapters to support your learning in depth.
The chapters are oriented around our answers to three questions that students might ask themselves.

-   **Why**: what will you learn about, what is our motivation?
-   **What** do we expect students to do?
-   **How** can the assignment be done?

You can read the chapters in whatever order you like.

Some may wish to start with our information on **what** we expect students to do [in Chapter -@sec-what] and on **how** the work can be done [in Chapter -@sec-how].
It may then be useful to come back to our information on the context and the motivations for the exercise [in Chapter -@sec-intro-why].
Of course, you can also start with our explanation for the motivations.

## Lecture recordings {#sec-report-intro-lecture}

The lecture material is presented in three short parts.

### Lecture recordings {#sec-report-intro-lecture-videos}

Click on a link and your browser should open a tab showing the *Panopto* video for the lecture part.
You should be able to access the videos anywhere; you should not need to be on campus or logged on to the university VPN to view the videos.

### Lecture recordings {#sec-report-intro-lecture-slides}

You can download the lecture slides in two different forms.

1. You can download the slides as a .html file:  [401-research-report.html](files/401-research-report.html). This can be opened in a browser and presents the slides as they are delivered.
2. You can download the slides as a Word .docx file:  [401-research-report-printable.docx](files/401-research-report-printable.docx). This can be opened in Microsoft Word. You can edit the file to write your own notes. And you can print the document. 

There will be some slight variation in how the images appear in the .html and .docx versions.
This is because I wrote the slides in `{Quarto}`, in R-Studio, and `{Quarto}` is designed to render *natively* to .html (so that images look nice in a browser).
