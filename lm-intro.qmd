## Overview {#sec-lm-intro-overview}

Welcome to our overview of the materials you will work with in our class introducing you to the **linear model** in *PSYC401* Week 9.

We will return to locate our learning in the context of the *Clearly understood* project. We will present our PSYC401 lessons in the context of this research project because we think that this context will help you to make sense of the data (as we explain in @sec-preface).

Remember: it is unclear how to make health communication more effective. The problem is that we are not sure how health information should be communicated so that everyone can understand it. This is why we ask the research questions:

1.  What person attributes predict success in understanding?
2.  Can people accurately evaluate whether they correctly understand written health information?

As we work together, we will be revisiting some of the ideas and techniques you have seen in previous classes. This is to give you the opportunity to consolidate your learning. We will be extending your development with some new ideas to strengthen your skills.

You can read a bit more about the project and the project data in @sec-associations.

## Our learning goals {#sec-lm-intro-goals}

This week, we focus on learning how to predict people: predicting observations about us (e.g., our attributes) or about the things we make or do.
To do this, we will learn to think about and work with *linear models*.

**Our learning objectives: --- what are we learning about?**

### Using the linear model to answer research questions

- We will learn how to:

1. code linear models
2. identify and interpret model statistics
3. critically evaluate the results
4. communicate the results

- Because we often want to know about relationships, asking questions like:

1. Does variation in X predict variation in Y?
2. What are the factors that influence outcome Y?
3. Is a theoretical model consistent with observed behaviour?

## Learning resources {#sec-lm-intro-resources}

You will see *next* links to the lectures we created to explain the concepts we want you to learn about and the practical visualization skills we want you to develop (@sec-lm-intro-lectures), *then* information about the practical materials we have provided to help you to practise your skills (@sec-lm-intro-practical).

All the links to the lecture videos, the lecture slides, and everything you need for your practical work can *also* be found in the Week 8 files folder on Moodle [here](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=40622#coursecontentcollapse9){target="_blank"}

In @sec-lm-intro-notes, we present the lecture slide points. We do this here because we can share the code we used to generate the plots we use in some of the slides [^visualization-intro-1]

[^visualization-intro-1]: We write the slides and this book in [Quarto](https://quarto.org){target="_blank"} in R-Studio. Quarto scripts can be rendered as .html to share web-books like this one, or to share slides like those we use in presenting the lecture. One advantage of using Quarto is that we can share a plot and the code we used to generate the plot in the same page.

::: callout-tip
**Linked resources** include:

-   In @sec-lmualization, we present a more extensive discussion of data visualization, elaborating on some ideas, incorporating additional example plots and enabling you to work with alternate data-sets. This is provided as *optional* reading and may support more advanced development for students interested in future professional roles involving data analysis or data visualization.
-   In the *PSYC403* Week 8, I present a lecture that outlines some *perspectives* or useful ways of thinking about data visualization: the history; the context in professional work; and what research suggests are effective ways to produce visualizations. You can access the resources for that class [here](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=40624#coursecontentcollapse9){target="_blank"}.

### Lectures {#sec-lm-intro-lectures}

The lecture material for this week is presented in four short parts. Click on a link and your browser should open a tab showing the *Panopto* video for the lecture part.

[Part 1 of 4](https://lancaster.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=b7324096-ad13-4ca1-b8ab-b0c000d85850){target="_blank"}

[Part 2 of 4](https://lancaster.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=8f42d056-6da6-4aba-b893-b0c000dc28d1){target="_blank"}

[Part 3 of 4](https://lancaster.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=05e049cb-277d-4d76-888d-b0c000df3c6f){target="_blank"}

[Part 4 of 4](https://lancaster.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=5fccaa55-9d07-4e24-8995-b0c0010fe92b){target="_blank"}

You can download the slides we presented in the lecture in two different formats, depending on what you think will be most useful to you:

-   Download the slides exactly as they appear in the lecture from [this link](files/401-data-visualisation-practices.html). The .html file can be opened and viewed in any web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
-   Or you can download a printable Word .docx presentation of the slides from [this link](files/401-data-visualisation-practices-printable.docx). The .docx can be opened in Microsoft Word. The figures will not appear exactly as they do in the lecture recording because Word cannot cope with images so well but the trade-off is that you get a document you can print and edit to add notes.

### Practical materials {#sec-lm-intro-practical}

We have collected the practical materials together into a folder.

The folder includes the data files:

-   `study-one-general-participants.csv`
-   `study-two-general-participants.csv`

and .R code files:

-   `401-visualization-how-to.R`
-   `401-visualization-workbook.R`

You will use these files for your practical learning.

You can download the .R files and the data .csv files in a single folder, using the link [here](files/PSYC401_visualization_materials.zip).

Or you can download the files as individual files from the module [Moodle page for PSYC401](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=40622#coursecontentcollapse9){target="_blank"}.

Once you have downloaded the file folder, you will need to upload it to the R-Studio server to access and use the R files.

#### The how-to guide {#sec-lm-intro-practical-how-to}

In the `how-to` guide:

-   `401-visualization-how-to.R`

we show you how to do everything you need to do in the practical workbook (see @sec-lm-intro-practical-workbook). The guide comprises an .R file `401-visualization-how-to.R` with code and advice.

The code in the .R file was written to work with the data file

-   `study-one-general-participants.csv`.

::: callout-tip
-   Work through the steps in the `how-to` guide first, this practice will help you to understand what you need to do for the `workbook` tasks.

-   The `how-to` guide and the `workbook` have similar structures. This is intentional: so that you can copy and *adapt* code from the `how-to` guide to do the practical tasks in the `workbook`.
:::

### The workbook {#sec-lm-intro-practical-workbook}

In the `workbook`:

-   `401-visualization-workbook.R`

you will work with the data file

-   `study-two-general-participants.csv`

We split .R scripts into parts, tasks and questions.

For this class on data visualization practices, our practical materials have two aims:

1.  Helping you to learn about data visualization;
2.  Helping you to learn how to help yourself by accessing, evaluating and exploiting the rich R knowledge ecosystem.

This means that in both the `how-to` and the `workbook` the different parts concern different sources of online information and how to access each.

In the `how-to` and the `workbook` we look at methods to produce visualizations that display information about both summary statistics (e.g., the average outcome) and raw or individual outcome variability. We explain why we should visualize data like this in the lecture (as you can see in @sec-lm-intro-lectures or @sec-lm-intro-notes).

Specifically, the materials are written to support learning how to work with visualizations called *boxplots* and *rain cloud* plots. These are popular data visualization techniques so it is important to learn how to build them and how to interpret them. If you have already been introduced to them, you will find that our materials here show how to edit or polish the visualizations to make them more effective.

There are three main sources of information you can access for free online.

1.  The people who write software like the `{tidyverse}` or `{ggplot2}` libraries provide manuals, reference guides and tutorials. This information is often written as free web books, or as hard copy books.

2.  These people, and often ther people, may write tutorials or guides or teaching materials designed to show learners (like us) how to use R functions or do certain things using R. They may present these tutorials or guides as web books, blog sites or video tutorials e.g. on Youtube or TikTok.

3.  Many post questions and answers to discussion forums like *Stackoverflow*.

Learning how to find, understand and use this information teaches two lessons:

-   A lot of scholarly and technical information is online and free.
-   Learning how to access this information is a key way that most professionals work out what they want to do and how they can do it.

In our practical materials, we look at how you can:

-   search for and find relevant information;
-   learn how to understand the tools using the information shared through online sources;
-   work with example or demonstration code, adapting it for your own purposes.

::: callout-tip
This process of adapting demonstration code is a process critical to data literacy and to effective problem solving in working with data in psychological science.
:::

**Part 3** in the `workbook` focuses on locating and using `{ggplot2}` reference information to learn how to build box plots.

**Part 4** in the `workbook` focuses on locating and using online tutorial information or how-to guides to build *rain cloud* plots. This kind of plot incorporates elements of the boxplot, the scatterplot and the density plot to give the viewer summary information about the distribution of scores on a variable while also giving information about the variability of outcomes.

**Part 5** in the `workbook` focuses on using information available in the public discussion *Stackoverflow* so that you can learn how to export the plots you make, in order to include them in reports.

The activity `401-visualization-workbook.R` file takes you through the tasks, one by one.

If you are unsure about what you need to do, check the advice in `401-visualization-how-to.R`.

You will see that you can match a task in the `activity` to the same task in the `how-to`. The `how-to` shows you what function you need and how you should write the function code. You will need to change the names of the data-set or the variables to complete the tasks in the activity.

### The data files

Each of the data files we will work with has a similar structure.

Here are what the first few rows in the data file `study-two-general-participants.csv` looks like:

```{r head}
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
kable(head(clearly.two.subjects))
```

You can see the columns:

-   `participant_ID` participant code
-   `mean.acc` average accuracy of response to questions testing understanding of health guidance
-   `mean.self` average self-rated accuracy of understanding of health guidance
-   `study` variable coding for what study the data were collected in
-   `AGE` age in years
-   `HLVA` health literacy test score
-   `SHIPLEY` vocabulary knowledge test score
-   `FACTOR3` reading strategy survey score
-   `GENDER` gender code
-   `EDUCATION` education level code
-   `ETHNICITY` ethnicity (Office National Statistics categories) code

### The answers

After the practical class, you will be able to download the answers version of the `workbook` here.

<!-- [401-visualization-workbook-answers.R](files/401-visualization-workbook-answers.R) -->

The answers version will present my answers for questions, and some extra information where that is helpful.

## Lecture notes {#sec-lm-intro-notes}

Some people find it easier to read notes than to watch video recordings. This is why we also include the lecture notes here.

::: callout-tip
In these notes, I provide notes on the code steps that result in plots.

-   Click on the `Notes` tab to see them.

            a1 = runif(250, .25, .75),
            a2 = runif(250, -.05, .05)
            )

}
```

### The linear model: our aims

1. Understand how to code: `lm(mean.acc ~ SHIPLEY)`
2. To answer questions like: **Is comprehension success influenced by vocabulary knowledge?**

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-scatterplot-shipley-acc-1
#| fig-cap: "Scatterplot showing the potential association between accuracy of comprehension and vocabulary scores"
#| fig-alt: "The figure presents a scatterplot indicating the association between variables mean accuracy (on y-axis) and vocabulary (x-axis) scores. The points are shown in grey, and clustered such that higher vocabulary scores tend to be associated with higher accuracy scores. The trend is indicated by a thick red line."
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 5

clearly.one.subjects %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = SHIPLEY, y = mean.acc)) +
  geom_point(size = 2.5, alpha = .5, colour = "darkgrey") +
  geom_smooth(size = 1.5, colour = "red", method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  xlim(0, 40) +
  ylim(0, 1.1)+
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    axis.text = element_text(size = rel(1.15)),
    axis.title = element_text(size = rel(1.5))
  ) +
  xlab("Vocabulary (Shipley)") + ylab("Mean accuracy")
```

### Using the linear model to answer research questions

- We will learn how to:

1. code linear models
2. identify and interpret model statistics
3. critically evaluate the results
4. communicate the results

### Thinking about relationships in psychologial science

We often want to know about relationships

- Does variation in X predict variation in Y?
- What are the factors that influence outcome Y?
- Is a theoretical model consistent with observed behaviour?

### Now consider our research aims in the *context* of the health comprehension project

1. Because public health impacts depend on giving people information they can understand
2. We want to know: **What makes it easy or difficult to understand written health information?**

```{r nurse-patient-talk-1, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap="flickr: Sasin Tipchair 'Senior woman in wheelchair talking to a nurse in a hospital'"}
knitr::include_graphics("nurse-patient-talk.png")
```

### Health comprehension project: questions and analyses

1. We want to know: **What makes it easy or difficult to understand written health information?**
2. So our research questions are:

-  What person attributes predict success in understanding?
-  Can people accurately evaluate whether they correctly understand written health information?

3. These kinds of research questions can be answered using methods like linear models

### Context: Individual differences theory of comprehension success

-   Understanding text depends on (1.) language experience and (2.) reasoning ability [@freed2017]

```{dot}
//| label: fig-comprehension-drivers
//| fig-alt: The diagram shows a flowchart, from left to right, nodes "Language experience" and "Reasoning capacity" are both connected by arrows to "Comprehension outcome".
digraph Q {
  rankdir="LR"

  node [shape=box];
  node [style=rounded];

  nd_1_l   [label = "Language experience"];
  nd_1_r   [label = "Reasoning capacity"];
  nd_2   [label = "Comprehension outcome"];

  nd_1_l -> nd_2;
  nd_1_r -> nd_2;

}
```

<!-- ![Freed et al., 2017; structural equation model, adult reading comprehension](freed-2017-fig1-sem-model-1.png){fig-alt="Freed et al., 2017; structural equation model, adult reading comprehension"} -->

### The measurement context: Where the data come from

-   We measure reading comprehension: asking people to read text and then answer multiple choice questions
-   We measure background knowledge: vocabulary knowledge (Shipley); health literacy (HLVA)

### Reflect: The kinds of critical evaluation questions you can ask yourself

-   Are multiple choice questions good ways to probe understanding? *What alternatives are there?*
-   Are tests like the Shipley good measures of language knowledge? *What do we miss?*

### Reflect: As we move into thinking about the data analysis, we need to identify our assumptions

1. **validity**: that differences in knowledge or ability cause differences in test scores
2. **measurement**: that this is equally true across the different kinds of people we tested
3. **generalizability**: that the sample of people we recruited looks like the population

### We need to think about the derivation chain

```{dot}
//| label: fig-derivation-chain
//| fig-cap: The derivation chain
//| fig-alt: The diagram shows a flowchart. The flowchart starts at the top with "concept formation" and "causal model" in the same subset, that subset is linked by an arrow to "measurement", "measurement" and "auxiliary assumptions" are linked to "statistical predictions", "statistical predictions" are linked to "testing hypotheses".
digraph Q {

  node [shape=record];

  nd_1_l   [label = "Concept formation"];
  nd_1_r   [label = "Causal model"];
  nd_2_l   [label = "Measurement"];
  nd_2_r [label = "Auxiliary assumptions"];
  nd_3   [label = "Statistical predictions"];
  nd_4   [label = "Testing hypotheses"];

  nd_1_l -> nd_2_l -> nd_3 -> nd_4;

  nd_2_r -> nd_3;

  subgraph cluster_R {

    {rank=same nd_1_l nd_1_r}

    nd_1_l -> nd_1_r [color= none arrowhead=none];

  }

}
```

### Questions, assumptions, predictions

Link: concepts, questions $\rightarrow$ assumptions $\rightarrow$ testable predictions

1. **concepts, questions**: Can people accurately understand health guidance? $\rightarrow$
2. **assumptions**: People who know more about language should also present more accurate understanding $\rightarrow$
3. **testable predictions**: Higher levels of vocabulary should be associated with higher levels of comprehension accuracy: we expect to estimate a positive coefficient

### One way of thinking about the association is to visualize it

- For each value of the predictor **vocabulary**
- Does the the value of the outcome **accuracy**
- *Increase or decrease?*

### Predicted association as *expected* change in average outcome

- @fig-scatterplot-ridges-shipley-acc-1 shows the distribution curve of mean (comprehension) accuracy scores observed at each value of vocabulary
- You can see that the middle -- the average -- of each distribution increases
- as we go from left (low scores) to right (high scores) on vocabulary

### How do we *estimate* the association between two variables?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "1|2|3"
model <- lm(mean.acc ~ SHIPLEY,
            data = clearly.one.subjects)
summary(model)
```

1.  Specify the `lm` function and the model `mean.acc ~ SHIPLEY`
2.  Specify what data we use `data = clearly.one.subjects`
3.  Get the results `summary(model)`

### The sentence structure of models in R

Take a good look:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
lm(mean.acc ~ SHIPLEY ...)
```

You will see this sentence structure in coding for *many* different analysis types

- `method(outcome ~ predictors)`
- `method` could be `aov, brm, lm, glm, glmm, lmer, t.test, cor.test`

### Results: How does the outcome vary in relation to the predictor? {.smaller}

```{r}
model <- lm(mean.acc ~ SHIPLEY,
            data = clearly.one.subjects)
summary(model)
```

- A model summary gives us estimates of:
- The coefficient $= 0.44914$ for the intercept
- The coefficient $= 0.01050$ for the slope of the SHIPLEY 'effect'

### These *coefficients* build a line

- The line represents:
- our prediction for how the outcome varies *on average*
- given change in the predictor

### So now we need to think about straight lines

<!-- -- gelman2021 p.37 -->

1. You may remember from school that to draw a straight line you need four numbers:

$$y = a + bx$$

2. We calculate the height $y$ by adding

- $a$ the intercept, the value of y when $x = 0$
- to the product of $b$ the coefficient for the slope of the line
- multiplied by $x$ the value of the predictor variable

### Let's draw it

<!-- -- gelman2021 p.37 -->

- Look at what we get if we draw the line using the linear model coefficients:
- $= 0.449$ for the intercept, $a$
- $= 0.011$ for the slope, $b$
- In the formula: $y = 0.449 + 0.011x$
- (I round the numbers to three decimal places.)

### We could draw a variety of different model prediction lines: how do we pick the *right* one?

We need to go back to the prediction model

- To calculate a predicted outcome value, we calculated it as: $\text{predicted y} = 0.449 + 0.011 \times \text{ Shipley score } 20$
- Assuming the linear model $\text{predicted y} = intercept + \text{slope } \times \text{ vocabulary}$
- But we missed a bit: **error**

### Linear models are typically estimated given sample data

- Maybe you noticed that I talked about how the model allows us to predict
- how the outcome varies **on average** given different values of the predictor
- When we use a linear model to estimate the intercept and slope -- to build the predictions -- we fit a model to the sample data
- And no model will fit sample data perfectly

<!-- -- gelman -- p.103 -- given more than two data points, cannot find a line that gives a perfect fit -->

### Linear models are typically estimated given sample data

<!-- -- gelman -- p.49 -- measurement error model -->

Usually, this means there are differences between the expected outcomes that the model predicts and the observed outcomes

- So we often write the linear model like this: $y = a + bx + \epsilon$

1. The observed outcome $y$ equals
2. the intercept $a$
3. plus the difference associated with a specific predictor value $bx$
4. plus some amount of mismatch or error $\epsilon$, the difference between the observed outcome and the predicted outcome

### We can derive the formulas used to calculate the estimates using calculus

- But we won't
- Because the linear model calculations are done using matrix solution algorithms in R *so we don't have to*
<!-- -- gelman -- p.104 -->

### We typically assume that the residuals are normally distributed

- Some are positive: observed outcome larger than predicted outcome
- Some are negative: observed outcome smaller than predicted outcome
- The average of the residuals will be zero overall

### Identifying the key information in the linear model results

- The `summary()` of the linear model shows ...
- The `Estimate` of the `Coefficient` of the effect of individual differences in vocabulary (`SHIPLEY`)
- how much the outcome `mean.acc` value changes, given differences in `SHIPLEY` score
- Associated `t value` and `Pr(> |t|)` statistics for the coefficient t-test
- Model fit statistics: `R-squared` and `F-statistic`

```{r}
model <- lm(mean.acc ~ SHIPLEY, data = clearly.one.subjects)
summary(model)
```

### For the effect of vocabulary (SHIPLEY), we have:

- The coefficient for the slope of the effect of variation in vocabulary scores: `0.01050`
- The `Std. Error` (standard error) `0.00229` for that estimate
- The `t `value `4.585` and associated `Pr(>|t|)` p-value `8.85e-06` for the null hypothesis test of the coefficient

```{r}
model <- lm(mean.acc ~ SHIPLEY, data = clearly.one.subjects)
summary(model)
```

### Identifying the key information in the results

- Pay attention to the **sign and the size** of the coefficient estimate:
- Is the coefficient (e.g., SHIPLEY `0.01050`) a positive or a negative number?
- Is it relatively large or small?
- We come back to this, shortly, in the context of interpretation and reporting

```{r}
model <- lm(mean.acc ~ SHIPLEY, data = clearly.one.subjects)
summary(model)
```

### The t-tests in the linear model

<!-- -- gelman -- p.147 -->
<!-- -- howell -- p.261, 275 pp.543-545 -->
<!-- -- cohen -- p.86 -->

$$t = \frac{\beta_j}{s_{\beta_j}}$$

<!-- - We follow statistical convention and refer to the coefficient estimate as $\beta_j$ (b) -->
- For each coefficient, the t-test is used to evaluate if the coefficient $\beta_j$ is significantly different from zero
- We assume the **null hypothesis** that the coefficient $\beta_j$ is zero
- We do the test by comparing the estimated coefficient $\beta_j$ with the standard error of the estimate

### The t-tests in the linear model

<!-- -- gelman -- p.147 -->
<!-- -- howell -- p.261, 275 pp.543-545 -->
<!-- -- cohen -- p.86 -->

$$t = \frac{\beta_j}{s_{\beta_j}}$$

- The standard error $s_{\beta_j}$ indicates our **uncertainty** about the estimate
- Larger standard errors represent greater uncertainty

### The t-tests in the linear model

<!-- -- gelman -- p.147 -->
<!-- -- howell -- p.261, 275 pp.543-545 -->
<!-- -- cohen -- p.86 -->

$$t = \frac{\beta_j}{s_{\beta_j}}$$

- Standard errors can be calculated using information about:
- Error in the model --- think of the distribution of residuals
- Variation of values in the predictor --- how widely they range
- The sample size
- Standard errors will be smaller for the coefficients of effects that appear to have bigger impacts, in models that describe outcomes better, in larger samples

### Identifying the key information in the results {.smaller}

- Pay attention to R-squared:
- The model summary gives us the `Multiple R-squared` and `Adjusted R-squared`
- These numbers represent how much of the variation in the outcome can be predicted by the model
- We usually report `Adjusted R-squared` because it tends to be more accurate

```{r}
model <- lm(mean.acc ~ SHIPLEY, data = clearly.one.subjects)
summary(model)
```

### R-squared -- what is it? -- an indicator of the proportion of outcome variation we can predict

- Better models should show smaller differences between observed and predicted outcomes
- R-squared ($R^2$) gives the proportion of outcome variance
- we can predict given information about differences in vocabulary

### R-squared as an indicator of the proportion of the outcome variation we can predict {.smaller}

- To understand what this means, look at the scatterplot
- On  average, values in outcome (accuracy) increase with increasing values in the predictor (vocabulary)
- But different people got different outcomes even with same vocabulary scores

The predicted trend is indicated by a thick blue line. Predicted outcomes, given different sample values of vocabulary are circled in black along the blue line. Light grey lines indicate the difference between predicted and observed outcomes. The observed points are darker red the further they are from the prediction."

### R-squared as an indicator of the proportion of the outcome variation we can predict {.smaller}

- So: we have variation in the outcome that is related to variation in the predictor
- And: we have variation in the outcome that seems unrelated to the predictor
- $R^2$ tells us how much variation in the outcome is explained by the model
- $R^2$ gives us a proportion where $R^2 = \frac{\text{predicted outcome variation}}{\text{total outcome variation}}$

### Identifying the key information in the results

- Pay attention to F:
- The model summary gives us the F-statistic:
- This is the test statistic for the test of the null hypothesis that the model does not predict the outcome

```{r}
model <- lm(mean.acc ~ SHIPLEY, data = clearly.one.subjects)
summary(model)
```

### Reporting the results of a linear model

- You will need to report three bits of information:

1. $R^2$ how much outcome variation is explained by the model
2. $F$ test for the null hypothesis that none of the predictors actually predict the outcome
3. Coefficient estimates with the t-tests for the null hypothesis for each coefficient

```{r}
model <- lm(mean.acc ~ SHIPLEY, data = clearly.one.subjects)
summary(model)
```

### The language and style of reporting linear model results

Here is an example of results reporting text that is conventional:

>We fitted a linear model with mean comprehension accuracy as the outcome and vocabulary (Shipley) as the predictor.
Our analysis indicated a significant effect of vocabulary knowledge.
The model is significant overall, with $F(1, 167) = 21.03, p < .001$, and explains 11\% of variance ($\text{adjusted } R^2 = 0.11$).
The model estimates showed that the accuracy of comprehension increased with increasing levels of participant vocabulary knowledge ($\beta = .011, t = 4.59, p <.001$).

### Look at what we do with the text

1. Explain what I did, specifying the method (linear model), the outcome variable (accuracy) and the predictor variables (health literacy, reading strategy, reading skill and vocabulary)
2. Report the model fit statistics overall ($F, R^2$)
3. Report the significant effects ($\beta, t, p$) and describe the nature of the effects (does the outcome increase or decrease?)

>We fitted a linear model with mean comprehension accuracy as the outcome and vocabulary (Shipley) as the predictor.

## Summary

- In psychological science, we often ask questions like:

1. Does variation in X predict variation in Y?
2. What are the factors that influence outcome Y?
3. Is a theoretical model consistent with observed behaviour?

- We can answer these questions using the linear model
- Given sample data, we can predict the average difference in outcome values, for different levels of a predictor variable
- We (or the math engine R uses) calculate the predictions so that they minimize the residuals, the errors of prediction or the mismatch between predicted and observed outcomes
- Our results report tells the reader about the model and the estimated effects
